# Solutions of Arfken 7th Edition
In this repository, you'll find the solutions of chapter 2.2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5.1, 13.1, 13.4 and 14.3 of Mathematical Methods for Physicists. 
It is not my intention to solve all the problems in the book but those that are not in internet.
Please, be aware that I also can make mistakes.
