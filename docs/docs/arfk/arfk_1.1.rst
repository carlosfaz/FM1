Infinite Series
-------------------

* Prove that if $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} n^{p} u_{n}=A<\infty, p>1,$ the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} u_{n}$ converges.
* Prove that if $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} n u_{n}=A>0,$ the series diverges. (The test fails for $\left.A=0 .\right)$ These two tests, known as limit tests, are often convenient for establishing the convergence of a series. They may be treated as comparison tests, comparing with

\sum_{n} n^{-q}, \quad 1 \leq q<p
